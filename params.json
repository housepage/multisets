{"name":"Multisets API for Scala Collections","tagline":"Multisets API for Scala Collections","body":"Multisets API for Scala collections (`Bag` trait)\r\n=========\r\n\r\nMultisets API for Scala is a new kind of collection (on scala) that is intended to have efficient implementations of multiset operations. Multisets are represented as: `scala.collection.Bag`\r\n\r\nThe multiset operations consist of: `union`, `intresect`, `diff`, `maxUnion` (a variant of union that represents the generalised set union), `contains`, `multiplicity`, `mostCommon`, `leastCommon`, ...\r\n\r\nIn Scala, the finite `Seq` can be used to represent multisets but are not optimized for their uses cases. Bag is not a subtype of Seq mainly because it has no indexing. `Bag` is not subtype (or supertype) of Set mainly because of incoherences between the definition of `union`, `intersect`, and `diff`. `Bag` is a subtype of `Iterable`.\r\n\r\nOther languages usually use a compact representation of multisets where the data structure keeps a mapping from it's elements to the multiplicity of that element.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `Bag` differs from those implementations by making the representation of elements more generic. Bag are mappings from elements to a BagBucket. This gives the possibility of implementing the bucket just like it is implemented in other languages or implementing custom buckets that fit some more specific purpose.\r\n\r\nThe key difference with other implementations is that buckets contain elements that are equivalent to each other but not necessarily equal. This give the user the possibility of grouping elements in a way that suits different needs.\r\n\r\nBag delegates subtasks of the Iterable methods to the underlying `BagBucket`. Therefore optimizations on buckets are reflected on the overall performance. For example if we take the compact representation it is possible to optimize filter (`forall`, `exists`, `contains`,...) to do only one check on the predicate.\r\n\r\nThe type of bucket that the bucket will have is defined at the construction of that bucket. It is defined using a `BagBucketFactory` that is implicitly taken into every constructor (ideally some default ones should be defined).\r\n\r\nThe code of bags looks like (input `-->` output):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimplicit val m1 = Bag.configuration.compact[Int] // define compact representation for Int\r\nimplicit val m2 = Bag.configuration.compact[Char] // define compact representation for Char\r\nBag.from(\"c\"->2, \"d\"->3)         --> Bag(\"c\", \"c\"; \"d\", \"d\", \"d\")\r\nBag(1,2,2,3,3)                   --> Bag(1;2,2;3,3)\r\nBag(1,1) union Bag(1,2)          --> Bag(1,1,1;2)\r\nBag(1,2,2,3,3).multiplicity(2)   --> 2\r\nBag(1,2,2,3,3).multiplicity(5)   --> 0\r\nBag(1,2,2,3,3)(2)                --> Bag(2,2) // Return equivalent elements\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// buckets will group Int that are equivalent modulo 3\r\nval mod3Equiv = new Ordering[Int] {\r\n   def compare(x: Int, y: Int): Int = (x % 3) - (y % 3)\r\n}\r\n\r\nimplicit val m = immutable.TreeBag.configuration.keepAll[Int](mod3Equiv)\r\n\r\nval bag = immutable.TreeBag.from(1 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 2 -> 1, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 1, 6 -> 1, 7 -> 1, 8 -> 1)\r\n\r\nbag(0)    --> Bag(6, 3, 3, 3) // equivalent modulo 0\r\nbag(1)    --> Bag(7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1) // equivalent modulo 1\r\nbag(2)    --> Bag(8, 5, 2) // equivalent modulo 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaven repository\r\n----------------\r\nThe last version of Scala multisets is 0.1\r\n\r\nScala multisets can be downloaded from Maven Central.\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>io.github.nicolasstucki</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>multisets</artifactId>\r\n  <version>0.1</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use it with SBT, just add the following dependency to `build.sbt`:\r\n```scala\r\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\"io.github.nicolasstucki\" %% \"multisets\" % \"0.1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
